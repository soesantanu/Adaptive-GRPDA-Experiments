This repository contains code for the paper titled "The Golden Ratio Primal-Dual Algorithm with Two New Stepsize Rules for Convex-Concave Saddle Point Problems" by Santanu Soe, Matthew K. Tam, and V. Vetrivel.

This repository contains Ipynb files and utilities for the numerical experiments evaluating **adaptive stepsize rules** and **partially adaptive stepsize rules** for Golden‑Ratio primal–dual algorithms (GRPDA) initially proposed by Xiaokai Chang & Junfeng Yang and
**E‑GRPDA**, **P‑GRPDA**, **aEGRPDA**, and **aGRAAL**.

We cover the following applications:

- **LASSO**
- **Fused Lasso** (1D total variation)
- **GraphNet** (2D grid graphs)
- **Sparse Logistic Regression** (LIBSVM datasets: `a9a`, `ijcnn1`, `mushrooms`)
- **Image Inpainting** (TV–L2 and TV–L1)
