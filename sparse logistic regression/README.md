In this experiment, we evaluate our proposed Algorithms 2 and 3 on the standard LIBSVM datasets \texttt{a9a}, \texttt{mushrooms}, and \texttt{ijcnn1}, and compare their performance with several related methods. Portions of the implementation are adapted from Yura Malitsky's public \texttt{graal} codebase on GitHub.

We consider two convex regularizers combined with the logistic loss (Settings~1 and~2) and report results for both settings on the above datasets; see the paper for the precise problem formulations and parameter choices.
